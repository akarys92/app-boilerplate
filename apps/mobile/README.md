# Mobile App (Expo)

The Expo React Native application shares business logic, data fetching, and UI primitives with the web client.

## Highlights

- Managed workflow with Expo SDK and EAS updates.
- NativeWind-powered design system sourced from `@app/ui-native`.
- AuthSession integration with deep links handled via `@app/auth`.
- Stripe React Native SDK wrappers from `@app/payments`.
- Chat + voice experiences optimized for mobile using `@app/voice`.

Use `pnpm expo start` to run locally once dependencies are installed.
